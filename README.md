# Machine-Learning-
In this repository I will share my steps toward learning tensorflow, keras, skilearn, pandas, numpy with respect to the very great book of 
'Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'. most of the codes are from the book but I have personally manipulated some of them 
so that I could learn the mane concepts and classes and librararies materials. 
I am happy to share my walksteps to learn Machine Learning approaches deeper in this repository.
