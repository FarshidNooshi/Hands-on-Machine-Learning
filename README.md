# Machine-Learning

## Introduction
<!-- In this repository I will share my steps toward learning tensorflow, keras, sklearn, pandas, numpy with respect to the very great book of 
'Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'. most of the codes are from the book but I have personally manipulated some of them 
so that I could learn the main concepts and classes and librararies materials.
I am happy to share my walksteps to learn Machine Learning approaches deeper in this repository.
I've implemented a regression project for predicting house prices and a binary classifier for predition of 5s on MNIST dataset. -->

### I will update this readme as soon as I finish the book, so this readme is a temporary readme for just presenting the idea of this repository.
